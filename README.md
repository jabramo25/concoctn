Concoctn is a recipe tracking app.  The home page will greet you with some recommendations of recipes to make based on the time of day.  You can add recipes that you've created on your own, or track modifications on recipes from other sources.  You can tag the recipes so that they are easier to find using the advanced search.  You can also view all your recipes formatted in a recipe list.
